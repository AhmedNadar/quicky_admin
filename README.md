## Projects

Simple app using [Active Admin](http://www.activeadmin.info/) and [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).

Using two main Models 'Product' and 'Task', Admin User can interact with them via Adtive Admin.

### The Good
* Active Admin makes it easy to create admin control panel 
* Easy integration for existing/new models
* Highly customizable
* Comes with a beautiful simple design

### The Bad (or not easy)
* Not easy to get user sign in/out using one simple user model
* Separate Admin from User system management
